Learning to use XCode also.

#### Current: [Exercise](https://www.learncpp.com/cpp-tutorial/1-3a-a-first-look-at-cout-cin-endl/)

Just a big collection of commented out scratch code, learning C++

##### Miscellaneous: 

std::cin and cout always go on the left-hand side of the statement.
std::cout is used to output a value (cout = character output)
std::cin is used to get an input value (cin = character input)
<< is used with std::cout, and shows the direction that data is moving from the r-value to the console. std::cout << 4 moves the value of 4 to the console
>> is used with std::cin, and shows the direction that data is moving from the console into the variable. std::cin >> x moves the value from the console into x
